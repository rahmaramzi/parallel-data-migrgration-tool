Objective:
Develop a tool to migrate data from one database to another efficiently and in parallel using Spring Batch.

This approach ensures fast and reliable data transfer while handling large datasets without performance degradation   

When migrating data between databases, developers often face two major challenges:
✅ Slow migration speed, especially with millions of rec                        
✅ High resource consumption if data is not processed efficiently.

By using Spring Batch, we can:
🚀 Divide the data into chunks and process them in parallel.
💾 Use Paging to fetch data in batches instead of loading it all at once.
🔁 Support Retry & Rollback to maintain data integrity.
🖥️ Execute the migration across multiple servers or processors using Parallel Step Execution.
  The migration system consists of three main stages:
1️⃣ Reading Data (Reader) – Fetching data from the source.
2️⃣ Processing Data (Processor) – Transforming the data if needed.
3️⃣ Writing Data (Writer) – Inserting the data into the target database.
 These stages will be executed in parallel using Spring Batch Parallel Steps
  The Importance of Spring Batch and Why It Is Used

Spring Batch is a powerful framework designed for processing large-scale data in an efficient and structured way. It is primarily used for batch processing, where large amounts of data are handled automatically without direct user interaction.
🔹 Why Use Spring Batch?
1️⃣ Processing Large Data (Big Data Processing)

    Spring Batch can handle millions or even billions of records efficiently.
    It is widely used in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to move data from one source to another.

📌 Example: Migrating customer data from an old database to a new one.
2️⃣ Performance Optimization with Parallel Processing

    Data can be split into chunks and processed in multiple threads or even across multiple servers to improve speed.
    Supports Parallel Step Execution and Partitioning, enabling concurrent execution of multiple steps.

📌 Example: Processing millions of banking transactions quickly across multiple servers.
3️⃣ Job Scheduling

    Spring Batch can be configured to run jobs automatically at specific times (e.g., every midnight).
    It integrates with Spring Scheduler and Quartz Scheduler for efficient scheduling.

📌 Example: Generating daily financial reports without manual intervention.
4️⃣ Error Handling (Retry & Skip Mechanisms)

    Supports Retry & Skip, allowing failed records to be retried or skipped instead of stopping the entire job.
    Logs errors and maintains execution history for audit & debugging purposes.

📌 Example: If inserting a customer record fails due to bad data, the job can either retry or skip the faulty record automatically.
5️⃣ Supports Multiple Data Sources

    Spring Batch can read and write from various data sources, such as:
    ✅ Databases (JDBC, JPA, Hibernate)
    ✅ Files (CSV, XML, JSON, Excel)
    ✅ Messaging queues (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ)
    ✅ REST APIs

📌 Example: Reading order data from an API and writing it to a database.
6️⃣ Job Execution Tracking & Restartability

    Spring Batch keeps track of job statuses and stores them in a database, allowing jobs to resume from the last checkpoint in case of failure.
    Supports Job Instance & Job Execution Context to ensure job continuity.

📌 Example: If a data migration fails due to a power outage, it can restart from where it left off instead of starting over.
7️⃣ Scalability & Distributed Processing

    Supports Spring Cloud Data Flow for distributing processing across multiple servers to maximize performance.
    Can run jobs on cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes seamlessly.

📌 Example: Processing real-time stock market data using multiple distributed servers.
🎯 When Should You Use Spring Batch?

✔ When dealing with large volumes of data that require batch processing.
✔ If you need to handle errors, retries, and rollbacks to maintain data integrity.
✔ When high performance is required through parallel processing and distributed execution.
✔ In applications related to ETL, record processing, report generation, data analytics, and job scheduling.
🚀 Summary

✅ Spring Batch makes large-scale data processing more efficient and faster.
✅ Supports Parallel Processing & Multi-threading for speed optimization.
✅ Provides error handling, retry mechanisms, and failure recovery.
✅ Can handle multiple data sources like JDBC, Files, APIs, Kafka.
✅ Integrates with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Data Flow for distributed job execution.
